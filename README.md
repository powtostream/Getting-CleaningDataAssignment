# Getting-CleaningDataAssignment
tidy_dataset1.csv - merged and extracted data for mean and standard deviation
tidy_dataset2.csv - independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
CodeBook.md - code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data.

# Transformations made to the original dataset

    * The data from X_test.txt and X_train.txt files was merged to the dataset with all values for 561 features and 10299 observations
    * For each measurement were extracted mean and standard deviation, which resulted to dataset with 66 variables
    * ID numbers for activities were replaced by descriptive labels
    * The new independent dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was made.
